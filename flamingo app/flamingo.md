Ok so if you are reading this you are probably looking at the python program in this folder named **_"flamingo.py"_**  
For this program to work you need the code in that file and the **_flamingo.png_** file  
Oh and also you need tkinter library  
You can simply install it using **_pip install tkinter_** if you don't have it  
  
  
  
ok i think its all i wanted to say here
